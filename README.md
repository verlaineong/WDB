# Rent Buddy Webpage

This is a fictional company, Rent Buddy.
 
Our company is a company that allows individual or families to rent a dog of their choice.

Our pet rental service allows you to "test-drive" the experience of owning a dog. Renting a dog from us provides a hands-on opportunity to understand the responsibilities, joys, and companionship that come with having a pet. It's the perfect way to assess if dog ownership aligns with your lifestyle before making a permanent decision. Additionally,  our service could be catered to people who wants to exprience the feeling of what it's like to rent a different dog breed.

## Design Process

User audience may be individuals or families looking to experience the pleasure of having a pet without the long term commitment. The website serves as a platform for users to explore our catalogue of friendly companions, showcasing the variety of pets available for rental. Visitors can discover the different dog breeds we offer and learn about the numerous benefits of choosing our pet rental service. Additionally, the website provides functionality for users to easily make bookings/contact. The website is targeted to people who are interested in booking their time with our rental dogs / interested in knowing more about our brand or dogs available to be rented.

**Reason behind my design**


•  **Visuals**

I chose orange and beige as my brand colour. The colour orange is associated with energy, enthusiasm and playfulness. It conveys the excitement, which aligns well with the joy and liveliness that dogs can bring into people's lives. The colour beige is a neutral and warm colour that evokes the feelings of comfort, which aligns with the service provided by Rent Buddy brand. For the design, I created adorable drawings of dogs and strategically placed them throughout the site, in the banners and as icons. The goal is to make the website not only informative but also visually pleasing.


•  **Layout and Structure**

I want my website layout to look clean and simple. The goal is to provide just the right amount of information to capture attention and encourage users to explore further without feeling overwhelmed by text-heavy content. Additionally, I include images of rental dogs, to attract customers and visitors to the website.

When designing the website, I took the booking process user-friendliness into consideration. Users can select their preferred dog for renting, and to facilitate this, I included visual ads with images on top of the form. Currently, there is one dog available for each breed. However, considering future expansions with more dogs, users may not easily recall each dog's name and might need to repeatedly check back.

During the testing i realised ths social media platform icons in the contact us page is not properly aligned to the bottom left ( below the contact form )

There were also several times when the heading of the text is behind the navigation bar, I had to adjust the margin & padding to make it visible.

I encounted problem when linking folders to in html for images and css, even after using assets/png/image.png

initially, I couldn't make my images responsive till I used flex-wrap: wrap;
