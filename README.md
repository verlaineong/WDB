# A first-level heading
## Design Process

• As a user, I want to see customer  testimonials on the Rent Buddy website to gain insights into the experiences of others who have rented pets through this service.

• As a user, I want a straightforward and user-friendly booking system on the Rent Buddy website, allowing me to easily make a booking.

• As a user, I want to view images and descriptions of each pet on the website to make an informed decision about which one to rent.

• As a user, I want to browse through the catalog of available pets to find which one to rent.
