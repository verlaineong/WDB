## Design Process

User audience may be individuals or families looking to experience the pleasure of having a pet without the long term commitment. The website serves as a platform for users to explore our catalogue of friendly companions, showcasing the variety of pets available for rental. Visitors can discover the different dog breeds we offer and learn about the numerous benefits of choosing our pet rental service. Additionally, the website provides functionality for users to easily make bookings. The website is targeted to people who are interested in booking their time with our rental dogs / interested in knowing more about our brand or dogs available to be rented.


**User Stories**

• As a user, I want a straightforward and user-friendly booking system on the Rent Buddy website, allowing me to easily make a booking.

**Reason behind my design**


•  **Visuals**

I chose orange and beige as my brand colour. The colour orange is associated with energy, enthusiasm and playfulness. It conveys the excitement, which aligns well with the joy and liveliness that dogs can bring into people's lives. The colour beige is a neutral and warm colour that evokes the feelings of comfort, which aligns with the service provided by Rent Buddy brand. For the design, I created adorable drawings of dogs and strategically placed them throughout the site, in the banners and icons. The goal is to make the website not only informative but also visually pleasing.


•  **Layout and Structure**

I want my website layout to look clean and simple. The goal is to provide just the right amount of information to capture attention and encourage users to explore further without feeling overwhelmed by text-heavy content. Additionally, I include images of rental dogs, to attract customers and visitors to the website.
