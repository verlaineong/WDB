		<h1>How we started Rent Buddy?</h1>
		<p> We are a group of passionate animal lovers who came together with a vision that would change the lives of both humans and animals. The idea sparked when we noticed the increasing number of wild and abandoned dogs struggling to find homes and loving families. Instead of simply adopting dogs and placing them in traditional homes, we envisioned a service that would benefit both the animals and people in need of furry friends.<br></p>
